#About the dataset
# context

How have American baby name preferences evolved since 1920? Which names have remained popular for more than a century, and how do they compare to the most recent top baby names? These are important considerations for many new parents, but the skills we'll practice while answering these questions are universal. After all, many businesses rely on understanding trends and popularity!

We'll be using data from the United States Social Security Administration, which lists first names as well as the number and gender of babies born in each year. We've limited the dataset to first names given to over 5,000 American babies in a given year to improve processing speed. From 1920 to 2020, our data spans 101 years.
